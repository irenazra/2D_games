# Corona_jetpack_game

## Main Current Focus
JD: Shooting 3 Lasers (:))
Iren: Make meteors more interesting (I am planning to swap them with an explosion images)


## To Do

- Scrolling should not end (until you finish the level) 
- Create multiple levels (3) 
- Be able to save which level you were at (text file)
- [DONE] Animation set up
- [DONE] Llama animation (some art)
- [DONE] Estanblish dimensions of the game (currently 128x128) (llama is 42x42)
- Make the meteors more interesting
- [DONE] Add more tiles 
- Fix the hit boxes (should not feel awkward)
- "You finished the level screen", get a break between levels, when you hit play pause a little bit 
- Missiles, lasers
- [IN PROGRESS : Currently we can detect what the player is colliding with and we can remove it from the screen. We can potentially add an explosion image to its place.] Destructible asteroids (make them a difference color and put cracks on them, set their positions to a value that is not on the screen) (THESE ARE DIFFERENT ASTROIDS) try to get a breaking animation


- Maybe random elements? random meteors?
- Add laser soubnd
